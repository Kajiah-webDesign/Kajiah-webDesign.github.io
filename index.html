           <p> In my little dorm I stay, <br>
               Dreams and dealines fill my day.<br> Coffee cups and 
               scribbled notes,<br>
 chasing words my heart just wrote. <br> The world
            feeles big, 
             but so am I,<br>
           A Sophmore reaching for the sky, <br>
           with every step, <br>I'll find my way <br>
           Buidling tommorrow from today.</p>
